# LaPro-UP
Personal College Project / Visual Support for Live Performance.

This code served as visual support for a live performance at the Universidad de Palermo of an interactive work titled "La Procrastinaci√≥n" which utilized a straightforward JavaScript interface integrated with Ableton Live. 

The setup featured a visual interface that displayed the remaining time for the artist to achieve a predefined goal, which involved drawing random requests from the audience. The artist had the option to either complete the task promptly or delay it by engaging in a jam live music performance. Audience members could interact by advancing the deadline by one minute at any time, triggering a visual response on the interface to indicate the urgency of the situation to the artist. This interactive cycle was designed to repeat throughout the performance, enhancing audience engagement and dynamism.
